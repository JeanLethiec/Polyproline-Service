        <h3>Polyproline II Secondary Structure Analysis</h3>

        <h4>Database objectives</h4>
            <p>The aim of this server is to propose a database and webserver dedicated to analyse and assign PPII.  </p>

        <h4>Type II Polyproline secondary structures introduction</h4>
            <p>Secondary  structures  have  a  key  role  in  the  structural  biochemistry  and  structural  bioinformatics. They are widely used to analyze the protein structures and understand structure assembly process. Two local repetitive structures, i.e., the alpha-helix and the beta-sheet, constitute the vast majority of theses secondary structures, while a third infrequent repetitive structure, the turn, had been also been  identified  and  used.  The  rest  is  associated  to  coil.  The  three  repetitive  secondary  structures have interesting conserved biophysical and geometric properties, while the loops are considered to have no recurrent conformations.</p>  
            <p>A  fourth  repetitive  structure  has  also  been  located  even  before  the  turns,  the  PolyProline  II  (PPII) helix identified in rich proline sequences. As no simple stabilizing interactions have been found within PPII  and  its  frequency  was  supposed  low,  it  was  considered  that  this  conformation  was  not  so important.  However,  recent  studies  shows  that  PPII  frequency  is  higher  than  expected,  and  they could be important for protein â€“ protein interactions. Surprisingly theses new analyses show that PPII are often not composed of Proline. </p>
